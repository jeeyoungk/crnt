# CRNT (Current)

CRNT is a TypeScript library for async and concurrent programming primitives.

- [Documentation](https://crnt.jeeyoungk.com/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install crnt
pnpm instsall crnt
bun add crnt
```

# Overview / Philosophy

- TypeScript - first
- Unopinionated, lightweight, and un-intrusive
- Support for modern constructs (ex: [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController))
- Performance - optimized for speed and reducing memory leaks.
- Synchronous and asynchronous methods.
